It features three central defenders providing a secure defensive base, a single defensive midfielder (pivot) shielding the back line, and four central midfielders capable of both supporting the defense and driving forward. Two strikers lead the attack, ensuring constant pressure on the opposition’s defensive line.\n\nThis setup is well-suited for matches where a team aims to control the midfield, dominate central areas, and maintain a strong attacking presence while still protecting against counterattacks. The compact nature of the midfield allows for quick ball recovery and sustained possession, but it requires disciplined positioning to avoid leaving the flanks exposed.",
