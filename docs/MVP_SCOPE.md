## üß© Core MVP Features

| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | **Save & Load Lineups** | Save current lineups locally (localStorage or JSON store). Saved configurations appear under the Saved Lineups tab and can be re-loaded into the builder. |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | **Tactics Tab** | Display formation diagrams, descriptions, and tactical advantages/disadvantages from the existing formation seed data. |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | **Field Responsiveness & Layout** | Maintain a consistent **1:2 pixel ratio (height:width)** for the field container, representing a standard 60√ó120-yard layout. Ensure all elements scale properly when resizing the browser window. |
